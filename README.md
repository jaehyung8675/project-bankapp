Bankapp

Demo - https://project-bankapp.netlify.app/

I designed frontend and developed functionality using JavaScript to build a bank application.

- Revamped UI and app interface to provide enhance user experience and achieve balance between functional and aesthetic.
- Created a login system along with automatic created username from users data and tested multiple functionalities: transfer money, request loan, close account.
- Built multi-features display summary and  movements by using data transformations and added sorting function.
- Implemented locale date, time, and number formatting by using Internationalization API.
- Implemented a countdown timer to logout automatically to protect security and privacy.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35616215/215192658-2b808577-25d4-49b5-9916-0ab95cc3ef52.png)
