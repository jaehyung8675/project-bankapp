I designed frontend and developed functionality using JavaScript to build a bank application.

- Revamped UI and app interface to provide enhance user experience and achieve balance between functional and aesthetic.
- Created a login system along with automatic created username from users data and tested multiple functionalities: transfer money, request loan, close account.
- Built multi-features display summary and  movements by using data transformations and added sorting function.
- Implemented locale date, time, and number formatting by using Internationalization API.
- Implemented a countdown timer to logout automatically to protect security and privacy.
